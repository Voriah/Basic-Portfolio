        Hi, I'm James, for the last 12 years my professional career has been in veterinary medicine. I've been a Registered Veterinary Technician in California for 10 years. I love working with animals, and through working in hospitals in Orange County I've found that my true passion is coming up with ideas to help streamline everyday life. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been a computer nerd since my family got our first computer. I remember being irrationaly upset when Windows 3.1 happened and I coundn't figure out how to play my games anymore. Then I found the command prompt (Huzzah!), and was finally able to run DOS and play Warcraft: Orcs and Humans again.         </p>
    <p>
        TLDR: I enjoy building things, breaking things, poking things just to see what will happen and coming up with solutions to problems that noone else perceives as problems.
